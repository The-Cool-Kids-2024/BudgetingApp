## Login: Allow users to create accounts or sign in using credentials.

Home Page: A central hub where users can view their financial overview, including income, expenses, and free money.

Income/Expense Tracking: Enable users to input and track their various sources of income and allow users to categorize and track their expenses. Provide predefined categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, rent) and the option to create custom categories.


Budget Creation: Enable users to set up monthly budgets for different expense categories. They should be able to specify budget amounts and duration.

Transaction Management: Allow users to add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions manually. Additionally, provide options for importing transactions from bank statements or linking bank accounts (if feasible).

Transaction Categorization: Automatically categorize transactions based on keywords or merchant information. Allow users to manually override categories if needed.

Reports and Insights: Generate basic reports and insights to help users understand their spending habits and budget performance. This could include visualizations like charts and graphs.

Reminders and Notifications: Send reminders to users about upcoming bills or budget targets. Notifications could also alert users about unusual spending patterns or reaching budget limits.

Settings: Allow users to customize app settings, such as currency, language, notification preferences, etc.

Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect users' financial data, including encryption, secure authentication, and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Feedback Mechanism: Include a feature for users to provide feedback or report issues directly within the app.

Remember, the goal of an MVP is to validate your app idea and gather feedback from users with minimal investment. Once you have a solid user base and feedback, you can iteratively improve and expand the app with additional features based on user needs and preferences.
