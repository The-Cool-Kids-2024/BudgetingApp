     * We are creating a "Web-based budgeting application."
     * We will be using a combination of the Waterfall and Agile system development process. 
     * For the coding part of the project, we will be using a `flutter/java` programming code. 
     * When we do testing for security reasons we will be using user input. 
     * We will be incorporating AI tools to help suggest how the user is doing with their budget and trucking good practice.
     * This project allows us to use our coding and collaborating skills.
     * If this project succeeds, it allow people to be able to do their budgeting independently or with family members.
